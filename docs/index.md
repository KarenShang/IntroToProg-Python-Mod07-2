# Use of Python Exceptions and Pickling

## Introduction
This page will discuss how to use .dat file within Python script and how to use python exception handling to relay errors to users. I will use Pycham to create two sets of scripts, first is will use picking to convert data into a .dat and then covert the data within that file back to a readable form.  Second, using the same script, I will use exception functions to relay errors to the user and to stop a read function within the script. 

```
import pickle  # This imports code from another code file!
# varibles -------------------------------------------- #
strFileName = 'AppData.dat'
list_of_data = [] #created from user input
strFist = None #string input data
strLast = None #string input data
```

### Using Exceptions in Python
## Summary
Through this assignment I the pickle module to write binary code to a recall binary data from .dat file. I also used exception handling to ensure users entered the correct type of data and were shown clear error codes if they did not. I also used exception handling to inform a while loop on when to break.
